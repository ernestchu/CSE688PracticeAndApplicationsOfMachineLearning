    "In the traditional image classification tasks, the entire image would be fed into the network. However, the object to be classified usually takes up only a partial region out of the entire image. Therefore, we can train a RL network to take **glimpses** on only part of the image, typically reletive small regions. The predicted next glimpse can also be passed in as input at the next timestamp, just like RNN!\n",
